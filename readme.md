# PySoar
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GliderGeek/PySoar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GliderGeek/PySoar)

**13-02-2020: soaringspot.com has restored direct downloads. the newest version of pysoar (>0.60) supports this**

**23-01-2020: soaringspot.com has removed the direct downloads from the daily results page.
Due to this change pysoar unfortunately no longer works for soaringspot URLs (it should for strepla)**

PySoar automates the analysis of glider competitions. It starts with a Soaring Spot URL and delivers a spreadsheet as output.

## Stand alone versions
Stand alone versions for Windows, Mac and Linux are available under [releases](https://github.com/GliderGeek/PySoar/releases).

Apart from Excel/Open Office for viewing the spreadsheet, no extra software is needed.

## Limitations
The following limitations are (currently) in place:

- no restart after 1st turnpoint
- no penalties for missing turnpoints -> outlanding
- no multiple start points


## Development
For development, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Install python requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building an executable
This chapter explains how to create a pysoar executable

Note: it is important to use the system python3.7
- running inside virtualenv causes wxpython issues
- running python3.8 causes PyInstaller issues

### Mac OS
- inside PySoar folder: `pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt` 
- `PYGEODESY_PATH=$(python3.6 -c "import pygeodesy; print(pygeodesy.__path__[0])")`
- `pyinstaller --windowed --paths=$PYGEODESY_PATH main_pysoar.py`

### Windows
- inside PySoar folder: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python3.6 -c "import pygeodesy; print(pygeodesy.__path__[0])"`
- `pyinstaller --windowed --onefile --paths=[INSERT_RESULT_PREVIOUS_LINE_HERE] main_pysoar.py`
